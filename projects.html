                The Healthcare-Provider-Directory was built to help my co-workers
                search for doctors in our hospitals. It was my first time using my
                coding knowledge to solve a real-world problem. Our company provided
                us with a spreadsheet containing thousands of doctors, making it
                difficult to search for providers and view their details.
            </p>
            <p class="project-description">
                I leveraged this file and converted it into an online directory where users can
                search by name, location, or specialty. This has improved efficiency
                in the workplace, making searches quicker and easier. My co-workers
                appreciate the simple and user-friendly approach.

                I developed a web application for individuals interested in training with me. 
                Users can sign up, log in, and create an account, during which they provide 
                details about their gym experience. Based on their responses, the app generates 
                a personalized workout routine, which updates every six weeks.

                Brisblogs was created to capture the excitement of spontaneous and last-minute trips. 
                This website features a collection of blogs where Bri shares her experiences at various 
                destinations worldwide. Users can explore each location through Bri's perspective, immersing 
                themselves in her stories. This is one of my more static websites and also my first to go live. 
                The initial planning was done on construction paper with markers, as I struggled to visualize the design at first. 
                Going back to basics was a valuable experience, allowing me to reflect on how much I've grown in my journey.</p>
