            <p>Healthcare-Provider-Directory was built to assist my co-workers in searching for Doctors in our hospitals.
               It was the first time I used my knowledge in coding to solve a real world problem. Our company offered us 
               thousands of Doctors through a spreadsheet and it was fairly difficult to search for the Providers and see
               their details. I used this file to my advantage and converted it into an online directory where you can search by name,
               location, or specialty. It has made the workspace efficient and quick. The workers are happy with the easy and simple approach to searching.

            <p>I built a web application for anyone interested in being trained by me.
                You would sign up on the app and log in.
                During the creation of your account the app will ask about your gym
                experience and depending on your answer, you will get a routine just for you.
                The routine will change every six weeks. This app makes working out easier
                by guiding you towards your goals daily. Very simple and easy to use. Each workout
                has a video demonstration and a description of the exercise. Once you complete a workout,
                you can log it and the app will keep track of your progress.
