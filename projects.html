                The Healthcare-Provider-Directory was built to help my co-workers
                search for doctors in our hospitals. It was my first time using my
                coding knowledge to solve a real-world problem. Our company provided
                us with a spreadsheet containing thousands of doctors, making it
                difficult to search for providers and view their details.
            </p>
            <p class="project-description">
                I leveraged this file and converted it into an online directory where users can
                search by name, location, or specialty. This has improved efficiency
                in the workplace, making searches quicker and easier. My co-workers
                appreciate the simple and user-friendly approach.

                I developed a web application for individuals interested in training with me. 
                Users can sign up, log in, and create an account, during which they provide 
                details about their gym experience. Based on their responses, the app generates 
                a personalized workout routine, which updates every six weeks.

                This app simplifies fitness by offering daily guidance toward users' goals. 
                It features a clean and user-friendly interface, with video demonstrations 
                and detailed descriptions for each exercise. Users can log completed workouts, 
                allowing the app to track their progress over time.
