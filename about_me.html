                Hi! I'm a self-taught Full-stack software developer specializing in web development. I have been coding since 2020 and I'm always looking to learn new things.
                The knowledge I have gained has helped me in real life situations. I was a personal trainer while I was learning and every new person I met needed a routine 
                made to meet their needs. I built a program that automated making routines for me. It was the most amazing feeling to see my knowledge being used in real life.
                everytime I think of a problem, I think about how coding can solve it. Making schedules at my current job, building a database to look up doctors, having different
                workouts at the touch of a button, etc.
            </p>
