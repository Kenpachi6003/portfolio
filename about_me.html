            <p class="about-description">
                Hi! I'm a self-taught full-stack software developer specializing in web development. 
                I've been coding since 2020 and am always eager to learn new technologies. The knowledge 
                I've gained has had a real-world impact.
            </p>
            <p class="about-description">
                While working as a personal trainer, I noticed that every client needed a custom workout routine. 
                To streamline the process, I built a program that automated routine creation, making my job more efficient. 
                Seeing my code solve real-life problems was an incredible experience.
            </p>
            <p class="about-description">
                Now, whenever I encounter a challenge, I instinctively think about how coding can provide a solution—whether 
                it's scheduling at work, building a doctor lookup database, or creating an on-demand workout system.
